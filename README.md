# the-cryptor

Text File ecnryption programme using python and an RSA Cipher

You have to click the Encrypt Button Once, and the results of encrypted data will automatical appear on the screen. However, If you click the Ecnrypt twice, or more, the program will continue ecnrypting over the ecnrypted file. Therefore to decrypt it to the original text file, you have to continue decrypting the file until it becomes readable text again.

To decrypt, Right Click on the taxh Area--> Select RUN--> (Pop Up tk Window appears)--> PIN [2143].

You have to enter the PIN otherwise an error message appears warning you entered wrong PIN. So make sure you enter correct PIN

The Decry Button is not working properly, I am waiting for iput as to howI can Bind the same POPUP function I bound on the POPUP->RUN. 
There is a progress bar embeded inside the Decryption Funtion. However, I didn't understand how to call it such that it runs based on the decryption progress.
