Text File ecnryption programme using python and an RSA Cipher

You have to click the Encrypt Button Once, and the results of encrypted data will automatical appear on the screen. However, If you click the Ecnrypt twice, or more, the program will continue ecnrypting over the ecnrypted file. Therefore to decrypt it to the original text file, you have to continue decrypting the file until it becomes readable text again.

To decrypt, Right Click on the taxh Area--> Select RUN--> (Pop Up tk Window appears)--> PIN [2143].

You have to enter the PIN otherwise an error message appears warning you entered wrong PIN. So make sure you enter correct PIN

The Decry Button is not working properly, I am waiting for iput as to howI can Bind the same POPUP function I bound on the POPUP->RUN. 
There is a progress bar embeded inside the Decryption Funtion. However, I didn't understand how to call it such that it runs based on the decryption progress.

Something else I want to achieve is this: 
  #Files should encrypt to the Filepath I choose upon selecting the text file to encrypt. Right now the filepath is static.
  
  #The Welcome textfield should be disbaled.
  
  #The Encrypted Text field should be disabled to avert the danger of someone changing any number by accident
  
  #ETC...............
 
 # Things to Note
 * Do not edit contents in the cr_k_ii.txt and the cr_k_ii.txt. They contain the Private and public keys. Changing any figure in these files can disturbe the behaviour of the encryption process.
 
 * The cr_k_i.txt text file contains items I wrote personally. It is the file whose contents are being encrypted and decrypted. You can change the contents and write your own.
